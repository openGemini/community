# openGemini Governance

## Principles

The openGemini community adheres to the following principles:

- Open: openGemini is open source community.
- Welcoming and respectful: See [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
- Transparent and accessible: Changes to the openGemini organization, openGemini code repositories, and CNCF related activities (e.g. level, involvement, etc) are done in public.
- Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with
  project objectives, scope, and design principles.

## Expectations from Maintainers

Every one carries water...

Making a community work requires input/effort from everyone. Maintainers should actively
participate in Pull Request reviews. Maintainers are expected to respond to assigned Pull Requests
in a *reasonable* time frame, either providing insights, or assign the Pull Requests to other
maintainers.

Every Maintainer is listed in the
[MAINTAINERS](./MAINTAINERS.md)
file, with their Github handle.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Please see the requirement [here](community-membership.md#maintainer)

## Changes in Maintainership

If a Maintainer feels she/he can not fulfill the "Expectations from Maintainers", they are free to
step down.

The openGemini organization will never forcefully remove a current Maintainer, unless a maintainer
fails to meet the principles of openGemini community,
or adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Decision making process

Decisions are build on consensus between maintainers.
Proposals and ideas can either be submitted for agreement via a github issue or PR.

In general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out between the persons involved.
If a dispute cannot be decided independently, get a third-party maintainer (e.g. a mutual contact with some background
on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.
If a dispute still cannot be decided, the project lead has the final say to decide an issue.

Decision making process should be transparent to adhere to
the principles of openGemini project.

All proposals, ideas, and decisions by maintainers or the project lead
should either be part of a github issue or PR.

## Github Project Administration

The __openGemini__ GitHub project maintainers team reflects the list of Maintainers.

## Other Projects

The openGemini organization is open to receive new sub-projects under its umbrella. To accept a project
into the __openGemini__ organization, it has to meet the following criteria:

- Must be licensed under the terms of the Apache License v2.0
- Must be related to one or more scopes of the openGemini ecosystem:
  - openGemini project artifacts (website, deployments, CI, etc)
  - Solutions that include openGemini
  - Other AI/BigData related processing
- Must be supported by a Maintainer not associated or affiliated with the author(s) of the sub-projects

The submission process starts as a Pull Request or Issue on the
[openGemini/openGemini](https://github.com/openGemini/openGemini) repository with the required information
mentioned above.
